The Number Plate Detector project is a computer vision application built using Python and OpenCV. The aim of this project is to develop a system that can automatically detect and extract number plates from images or video streams. The system utilizes the power of image processing techniques provided by OpenCV library to achieve accurate and efficient detection of number plates.Python programming language is used due to ease of integration with OpenCV. By combining Python, OpenCV, and various image processing techniques, the Number Plate Detector project allows for the automated and accurate detection and recognition of number plates in images or video streams. This technology finds applications in traffic monitoring, parking management, law enforcement, and automated toll collection systems.
